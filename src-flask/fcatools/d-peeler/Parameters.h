// Output
/* OUTPUT turns on the output. This option may be disabled to evaluate the performance of d-peeler independently from the writing performances of the disk. */

// Heuristics
/* SORT_ITEMS turns on the heuristic consisting in independently sorting the items of each dimension to first consider the least dense. Disabling it considerably decreases the performances of d-peeler. */

/* SORT_DIMENSIONS turns on the heuristic consisting in reordering the dimensions to minimize both the space requirement for the data set and its access costs. */
#define SORT_DIMENSIONS

/* ENUMERATION_PROCESS is used to select the procedure aimed at choosing on which dimension should the next item be enumerated: */
/* 0: the chosen dimension has the smallest number of remaining potential items */
/* 1: the chosen dimension maximizes the quantity of potential items that may be absent after propagation */

/* VERBOSE_PARSER turns on the output (on the standard output) of information when the input data file is parsed. */

/* NB_OF_CLOSED_N_SETS turns on the output (on the standard output) of how many closed n-sets were selected during the extraction phase. */

/* PRUNING_DETAILS turns on the output (on the standard output) of a detailed analysis of how the tree is pruned. This option may be enabled by someone who wants to have a broad view of the tree w.r.t. the enumeration process and the data set. It gives (in this order): */

/* TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of the running time of d-peeler. */

/* DETAILED_TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of a more detailed analysis of how the time is spent. It gives (in this order): */
/* - the parsing time */
/* - the pre-processing time */
/* - the mining time */
/* - the post-processing time (if it is a minimization) */
/* - the time spent checking the maximality of the computed patterns */
/* - the time spent propagating the absence of certain items (when another is set present) */
/* #define DETAILED_TIME */
