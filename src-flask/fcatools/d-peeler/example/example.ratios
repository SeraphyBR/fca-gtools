You can write whatever you want (e.g., the extracted closed n-sets)
AFTER the ratios. Notice that the diagonal relates to minimal numbers
of elements in the groups to be present in every computed closed
n-set. The other values are ratios between the number of elements in
the group in line with the number of elements in the group in
column. The order of the groups is that of the file names set with the
--groups option.
