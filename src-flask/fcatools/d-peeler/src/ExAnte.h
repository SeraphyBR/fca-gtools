/*
 * Removes tuples from the dataset without changing the results of mining closed patterns.
 *
 * The removed tuples surely can't be in a closed n-set with respect to
 * the minimum sizes per dimension restrictions.
 * \param tuples the tuples from datasets.
 * \param minimumSize a vector containing, for each dimension, the minimum
 *                    number of items from that dimension that need to be
 *                    in a closed n-set so that the size restrictions are
 *                    respected.
 * \param symmetricDimensionsIds the indices of the dimensions that are symmetric. If one
 *                    tuple is removed, all the tuples that can be obtained by permuting
 *                    the symmetric dimensions are also removed. This vector should be
 *                    already sorted.
 * \return A new set of tuples with the same number or less of tuples of the original
 *         data set. The results of mining closed patterns in this new set, subject to
 *         the minimum size constraints, is equal to mining the old data set.

 * smaller, which can make for a faster pattern mining.
